This should be the base starting point for any custom Uber Task App.

Uber Task is a brand new solution to an everyday problem. The heart of Uber Task is a set of custom personal web browsers that are interconnected to share data between them. They are not "Generic" web browsers. but instead, "Task" optimized.  Basically, a complex, repeating, everyday workflow can be converted into one button click from your desktop. You do your work, then a subset of your work is available on your smart phone/tablet for offline or field work.

That is the concept. But it is not built yet. Please get involved.
